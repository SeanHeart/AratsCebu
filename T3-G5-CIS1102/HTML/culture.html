                    del Santo Niño, where a performance will be held which is a re-enactment of the island’s Christianization.</p>

    <p align="justify">Wake or vigil is one peculiar aspect of Cebu’s customs and traditions which is still in practice to this day.
                       Wake usually takes five to seven days or even longer if the bereaved family is still waiting for someone’s arrival 
                       from distant provinces or from outside of the country. The dead body is preserved by embalming it and placing it in a 
                       coffin surrounded with some ornaments, including flowers, photo of the dead, and funeral lights.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       During these five to seven (or longer) days, the visitors are given something to eat such as snacks. The family members 
                       or at least someone should stay awake during the night because they are not allowed to leave the dead alone, so what they do on 
                       this occasion is that people would either talk for the whole night or play board games, card games and some are even gambling to 
                       pass the time. But before the games and talking, there is a scheduled time to pray for the dead.</p>

    <p align="justify">Superstitious beliefs do not only apply to Cebuanos but also the people outside of Cebu as well. Some of 
                       the superstitious beliefs for Cebuanos are, black cats are a sign of bad luck or death, sweeping the floor 
                       when there’s a wake, fishbone dilemma, and more.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       Cats can be a symbol of luck and prosperity in other countries but in Cebu, a lot of people believe that a black 
                       cat is a sign of bad luck. Accidentally crossing paths with one is taken as a bad omen of misfortune and even death.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       Cebuanos believe that when you sweep the floor during a wake it could drive away the spirit of the dead and may bring 
                       bad luck, such as another family member might follow the dead to the afterlife.
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       For the fishbone dilemma, when you have a fishbone stuck in your throat, Cebuanos believe that letting a cat gently 
                       scratch your throat will remove the fishbone. But when doing so, make sure that the cat is not aggressive as it can cause 
                       serious scratches around your neck.</p>

    <p align="justify">Similar to other places in the Philippines, Cebuanos also have this serenade or harana in Filipino, but in Cebuano, it’s called ‘balak’. This is when a man is in love with a girl. He takes his first step by visiting her at home with the consent of the girl’s parents, dressed in his best clothes, and bringing homemade delicacies and serenades. Sometimes the man will bring another person or a third person to act as his go-between to help him win over the girl he loves. Another important requirement when serenading is when the parents of the girl ask for a living dowry consisting of a certain amount of money and some valuable pieces of jewelry.

                       <br>
                       When a man is doing a serenade to the girl he loves, it takes him a very long time before the girl answers his proposal.</p>

    <p align="justify">Cebu City retains its long Spanish heritage. There is a site where Ferdinand Magellan landed on April 7, 1521. He sealed a blood compact with the chief of Cebu, Humabon. But later on, he was killed by Chief Lapulapu of nearby Mactan Island.

                       Cebu was the Spanish colonial capital for six years and it remained the primary Spanish bastion in the southern part of the country.</p>
